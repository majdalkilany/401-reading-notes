# pain VS.suffering 

the That accelerated learning environment is great, but it does come at a price **that price is pain, the pain of growth**

the pain is different from vsuffering 

Suffering is pain without purpose. Pain with no higher goal. Pain with no dreams.


As you experience pain, seek the remedy! Ask questions that bridge the gap between what you know and what you need to be able to do. Research! Build your resources and your community! Don’t experience the pain in silence—that slides toward needless pain and the realm of suffering.

Search for  the common thread that makes the pain worthwhile .

It’s not easy, nor is it common. This is why such skilled people are highly-valued in the industry. You are building your value. You are experiencing the pain of growth. Live it, love it, and take it forward into your future as a full-stack software developer capable of meeting all challenges with a clear head and strong heart.


# Big O notation

**What is big O?**
Big O notation is used in Computer Science to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm


* Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used

lets see  some common orders of growth along with descriptions and examples where possible.

#### O(1)

O(1) describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

#### O(1)
 describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

 #### O(N2)


represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set. This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.

#### O(2N)
 
 denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set. The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically. An example of an O(2N) function is the recursive calculation of Fibonacci numbers:


 ### Binary search

 is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value. If the values match it will return success.
